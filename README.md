# Learning lab 👨‍🔬

A learning laboratory where I evolve my code day by day, exploring new concepts and development practices.

## About the project 📚
This is a web application using JPA. The goal is to improve it day by day by adding new features and enhancing the code.

## How to run 💻
### There are two ways to run this app
- Tomcat: Currently, there’s no UI implemented (as of 30/09/25), so running via Tomcat is not recommended 🐛
- Test class: Use this class to test the CRUD operations for users 🙃

❗ // TODO: Add setup and usage instructions (e.g., how to run the app, configure database)
